# VLSI-Design-Digital-System

## Overview
This project focuses on VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) design using Cadence Virtuoso software. It encompasses a range of digital circuit designs, from basic logic gates to a simple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit). The project provides comprehensive details including schematics, symbols, testbenches, simulations, layouts, post-layout simulations, DRC (Design Rule Check), LVS (Layout Versus Schematic), and calculations.

## Features
- **Basic Logic Gates**: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR
- **Advanced Designs**:
  - Inverter
  - Transmission Gate
  - 1-Bit Adder/Subtractor
  - 4-Bit Adder
  - Multiplier
  - Divider
  - D-FlipFlop
  - Multiplexers (2:1, 8:1)

## Technologies
- Cadence Virtuoso

## Design Details
The project includes detailed designs and analyses for each component:
- **Schematics**: Circuit diagrams for each design
- **Symbols**: Standardized symbols used in the designs
- **Testbenches**: Test setups for validating the designs
- **Simulations**: Pre- and post-layout simulations to verify functionality
- **Layouts**: Physical layout designs of the circuits
- **DRC**: Design Rule Check to ensure layout compliance
- **LVS**: Layout Versus Schematic to verify layout accuracy
- **Calculations**: Detailed calculations and analyses of the designs
